## LDA General Questions
1. What are we maximizing in LDA?
2. What are we minimizing in LDA?
3. How do we combine them?
4. Is LDA supervised learning?
5. True or False - LDA can only have 2 classes.

## Support Vector Machine General Questions
1. True or False - The support vectors define the boundary
2. What are we trying to maximize?
3. Can SVMs be used for regression?
4. What are three common kernels?
5. Why are there two parameters to the kernel function?
6. What is the kernel trick?
